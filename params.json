This CLI tool is available in github as open source :  https://github.com/racker/rackspace-monitoring-cli\r\nInstall the rackspace-monitoring-cli using the pip tool.\r\n\r\nConfiguring the RaxmonCLI\r\n\r\nUnder your home directory from where you would like to run the raxmon tool create a .raxrc file. Enter the following in the file\r\n\r\n[credentials]\r\nusername=<<YOUR USERNAME>> \r\napi_key=<<YOUR API KEY>>\r\n[api]\r\nurl=https://monitoring.api.rackspacecloud.com/v1.0\r\n[auth_api]\r\nurl=https://identity.api.rackspacecloud.com/v2.0\r\n[ssl]\r\nverify=true \r\n\r\nFor the complete installation steps you will find the document in http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/getting-started-with-remote-monitoring\r\n\r\nOnce the RaxmonCLI have been configured test the same by using raxmon-entities-list.\r\n\r\nCopy over the script raxmon-monitoring-create.sh to the same home directory and give the script executable privileges.\r\n \r\nRunning the Script\r\n\r\nOnce you run the script , it will display the list of servers which is presently being monitored. If the server for which you would like to configure the new check is already then use the id for the same or else create a new server to be monitored.\r\nNow it will list out the list of email address for which you would like to configure the alerts. If all the email address exist then use them , if not create a new plan with all the email address.\r\nThen it will ask the type of check you want to configure you can select 1 for HTTP, 2 for PING and 3 for IMAP.\r\nAnswer all the set of questions and your script would be created.\r\nBy default this script makes use of 3 different monitoring zones (mzlon,mzdfw,mzord) however you will be easily able to change this. \r\n\r\nNote: This script would be helpful when creating multiple checks for multiple servers.\r\nTo make modification to the checks or to add 1-2 servers or checks you can always login to the GUI : https://ui-labs.cloudmonitoring.rackspace.com/\r\n\r\nPlease contact Win2ix Systems if you have any issues or for any modifications at http://www.win2ix.ca     \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
